# 
# - file: the log file to watch. It must exist
# - mirror: the mirror path.
#               By default, it's the same as the file path, with the suffix ".mirror" appended.
# - diff: the diff path.
#               By default, it's the same as the file path, with the suffix ".diff" appended.
# - hooks: the directory containing the hooks.
#               By default, it's the same as the file path, with the suffix ".hooks.d" appended.
#                  
#               A hook is being executed based on its file extension.
#               Accepted languages are:  
#                   - bash (.sh)  
#                   - php (.php)  
#                   - ruby (.rb)  
#                   - python (.py)  
#                   - perl (.pl)  
# - v: verbose, use this option to have a more verbose output.                 
#                 
# Hook scripting
# ----------------------                
#                 
# Inside a hook, the following rules appy:
# 
# - anything that is printed will be printed as is on stdOut.
#         Except for a line that starts with 'error:'; this line would be send to the error core function of the logChangeNotify script.
#         This is the only way hook authors can gain access to the error method of the logChangeNotify script, which might be useful
#         if you care about redirecting the (logChangeNotify) stdErr file descriptor. 
#         
# - logChangeNotify gives you one variable: LOG_CHANGE_NOTIFY_DIFF, which is accessible from your script environment
#     (for instance, $_SERVER['LOG_CHANGE_NOTIFY_DIFF'] in php),
#     and which value is the path to the diff file.
#     The hooks should parse the diff file and do something with it, because after all the hooks have been executed,
#     the diff file is removed by the logChangeNotify script.
#
